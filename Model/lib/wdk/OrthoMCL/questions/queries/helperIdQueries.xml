    <!--
    A "query" obtains tabular values from a data source.  It has columns
    and parameters.  So far, only SQL data sources are supported, but others,
    such as flat files are coming.  

    Queries are used for different purposes: providing primary keys to a 
    question; providing attributes and tables to a record; and, providing
    vocabularies to vocabulary parameters.

    A "query set" is a grouping of queries.  It is useful in organizing the
    model xml file.  

    The full name of a query is of the form "set_name.name."
